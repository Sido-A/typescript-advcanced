# Typescript Advance stuff

- Class
    - protected, private, public (scoping constructor)
    - abstract (Can't create instance.The class which extends the abstract class must define all the abstract methods.)
 

- Interface
    - Uses Class Name 'implements' 'implementation Name' and not 'extends'
    - A structure of Classes, interface to describe the requirement(can have an optional requirement using '?')


 - Generics & Constraints
    - Generics give a flexibility combined with type safety
    - Generics help to create a data structure that work together or wrap values of a broad variety of types (e.g. an array that can hold any type of data).
    - Constraints allow you to narrow down the concrete types that may be used in a generic function etc.


- Built in stuff
    - Partial
    - Readonly

- Decorators 
    - (need to uncomment ts.config => "experimentalDecorators": true)
