# Typescript Advance stuff

- Class
 - protected, private, public (scoping constructor)
 - abstract (Can't create instance.The class which extends the abstract class must define all the abstract methods.)
 

- Interface
 - Uses Class <name> 'implements' <this name> and not 'extends'
 - A structure of Classes, interface to describe the requirement(can have an optional requirement using '?')


 - Generics
  - Gives a flexibility combined with type safety
